## 🌿 Team Workflow & Branching Strategy

To maintain code quality and avoid conflicts, **every team member must work on feature branches**.

### 🪄 Step-by-Step Development Guide:

1. **Always start with the latest main branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Create a new feature branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/issue-description
   ```

3. **Make your changes and commit:**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add property search functionality"
   # Use conventional commit messages:
   # feat: for new features
   # fix: for bug fixes
   # docs: for documentation
   # style: for formatting
   # refactor: for code refactoring
   ```

4. **Push your branch to GitHub:**

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Create a Pull Request (PR):**

   - Go to GitHub repository
   - Create PR from your branch to `main`
   - Add description of changes
   - Request review from team members

6. **After PR approval:**
   - Team lead will merge the PR
   - Delete the feature branch

### 🔄 Sync Your Local Repository:

```bash
# Fetch latest changes from main
git fetch origin

# Rebase your feature branch
git checkout feature/your-feature-name
git rebase origin/main

# Resolve any conflicts if they occur
```
